I created a powerful tool using Python for face recognition and comparison, capable of analyzing both images and video frames. This tool uses the face_recognition and cv2 libraries to identify and compare faces, with a special focus on distinguishing between live and non-live video footage. It features a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, allowing you to select images or videos, extract frames, and compare faces efficiently. Additionally, the tool can batch process images from a folder, identifying matches with the provided input image and displaying the results in a visually appealing manner.
This Project includes a few of python files try running them after installing the required libs and have fun ....
